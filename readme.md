# Markdown Viewer
This is a very simple markdown viewer

Note: this project is **discontined**, the [morkdown
project](https://github.com/rvagg/morkdown) has a more modern framework.

## Customization
The style can be changed in the `res/style.css`.

Modifying `res/highlight.css` for highlighting style

The syntax highlighting:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;
using std::endl;

int main() {
    cout << "hello mdview" << endl;
}
```

## Now Support latex
Try this read me in the mdviewer! 

This is a latex testing:

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
